#      @(#)bpf.h       7.1 (Berkeley) 5/7/91

# This is libpcap's cut-down version of bpf.h; it includes only
# the stuff needed for the code generator and the userland BPF
# interpreter, and the libpcap APIs for setting filters, etc..
#
# "pcap-bpf.c" will include the native OS version, as it deals with
# the OS's BPF implementation.
#
# At least two programs found by Google Code Search explicitly includes
# <pcap/bpf.h> (even though <pcap.h>/<pcap/pcap.h> includes it for you),
# so moving that stuff to <pcap/pcap.h> would break the build for some
# programs.
