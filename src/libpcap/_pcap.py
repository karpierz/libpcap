#
#    send mail to "tcpdump-workers@lists.tcpdump.org", requesting

#
# Link-layer header types are assigned for both pcap and

# the link-layer header type field in an Interface Description
# Block is 16 bits, so only the bottommost 16 bits of the
# link-layer header type in a pcap file can be used for the
# header type value.
#
# In libpcap, the upper 16 bits, from the top down, are divided into:
#
#    A 4-bit "FCS length" field, to allow the FCS length to
#    be specified, just as it can be specified in the if_fcslen
#    field of the pcapng IDB.  The field is in units of 16 bits,
#    i.e. 1 means 16 bits of FCS, 2 means 32 bits of FCS, etc..
#
#    A reserved bit, which must be zero.
#
#    An "FCS length present" flag; if 0, the "FCS length" field
#    should be ignored, and if 1, the "FCS length" field should
#    be used.
#
#    10 reserved bits, which must be zero.  They were originally
#    intended to be used as a "class" field, allowing additional
#    classes of link-layer types to be defined, with a class value
#    of 0 indicating that the link-layer type is a LINKTYPE_ value.
#    A value of 0x224 was, at one point, used by NetBSD to define
#    "raw" packet types, with the lower 16 bits containing a
#    NetBSD AF_ value; see
#
#        https://marc.info/?l=tcpdump-workers&m=98296750229149&w=2
#
#    It's unknown whether those were ever used in capture files,
#    or if the intent was just to use it as a link-layer type
#    for BPF programs; NetBSD's libpcap used to support them in
#    the BPF code generator, but it no longer does so.  If it
#    was ever used in capture files, or if classes other than
#    "LINKTYPE_ value" are ever useful in capture files, we could
#    re-enable this, and use the reserved 16 bits following the
#    link-layer type in pcapng files to hold the class information
#    there.  (Note, BTW, that LINKTYPE_RAW/DLT_RAW is now being
#    interpreted by libpcap, tcpdump, and Wireshark as "raw IP",
#    including both IPv4 and IPv6, with the version number in the
#    header being checked to see which it is, not just "raw IPv4";
#    there are LINKTYPE_IPV4/DLT_IPV4 and LINKTYPE_IPV6/DLT_IPV6
#    values if "these are IPv{4,6} and only IPv{4,6} packets"
#    types are needed.)
#
#    Or we might be able to use it for other purposes.

# This routine can scan a directory for savefiles, list local capture
# devices, or list capture devices on a remote machine running an RPCAP
# server.
#
# For scanning for savefiles, it can be used on both UN*X systems and
# Windows systems; for each directory entry it sees, it tries to open
# the file as a savefile using pcap.open_offline(), and only includes
# it in the list of files if the open succeeds, so it filters out
# files for which the user doesn't have read permission, as well as
# files that aren't valid savefiles readable by libpcap.
#
# For listing local capture devices, it's just a wrapper around
# pcap.findalldevs(); code using pcap.findalldevs() will work on more
# platforms than code using pcap.findalldevs_ex().
#
# For listing remote capture devices, pcap.findalldevs_ex() is currently
# the only API available.
